<ul>
<li>In Paul's day, Galatia has an ethnic/geographical and political/geographical referent:
<ul>
<li>Ethnic referent (North Galatia) [Lightfoot]
<ul>
<li>Cities: Ancyra (moderen Ankara)</li>
<li>It's not clear that Paul's visit to N. Galatia is recorded in Acts. Proponents of this view interpret "Galatia" in Acts 16:6, 18:23 to refer to N. Galatia. If this is so &#x2026;
<ul>
<li>In 2nd missionary journey, after revisiting the cities of the 1st missionary journey (Acts 16:1-4), "Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia" (16:6).</li>
<li>Thus, if Paul wrote to ethnic Galatia, the earliest date for this letter would be after this visit (about AD 50).</li>
<li>Moreover, if Gal 4:13 refers to 2 visits to Galatia, then the 2nd visit is implied in Acts 18:23 "Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia" at the beginning of his 3rd missionary journey.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>The classic N. Galatia theory then holds that Paul wrote Gal sometimes during the 3rd missionary journey (about AD 55-56).</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Political referent (South Galatia) [Ramsey, Bruce]
<ul>
<li>We find Paul in provincial Galatia during the 1st missionary journey.
<ul>
<li>Acts 13-14</li>
<li>Cities: Pisidian Antioch, Lystra, Iconium, Derbe</li>

</ul></li>
<li>=&gt; We can (though not necessary) date Galatians as early as immediately after the 1st missionary journey, before the Jerusalem council.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Summarizing factors
<ul>
<li>Romanization
<ul>
<li>Paul typically work in Romanized countries, and N. Galatia was not very Romanized in 1st century. Major roads not constructed until 70s and 80s.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Synagogues
<ul>
<li>The agitators were seeking to integrate Gentile Christians into synagogues. We have no firm evidence of Jewish influence in N. Galatia until the 3rd century.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Evidence for Pauline mission in N. Galatia is fragmentary. 
<ul>
<li>S. Galatia
<ul>
<li>No dispute that Paul evangelized cities here.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>N. Galatia
<ul>
<li>Inconclusive that Paul evangelized here</li>
<li>Proponents point to Acts 16:6; 18:23, claiming that these 2 texts refer to the 2 visits that Gal 4:13 indicate.</li>
<li>But it's unclear whether Galatia in these 2 texts refers to N or S Galatia
<ul>
<li>Favoring N:
<ul>
<li>sequence of movements by Acts 16:1-6,
<ul>
<li>esp. if κωλυθέντες in 6:6 is translated as causal, "They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia because they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia".</li>
<li>Looking at the map, it makes more sense that Galatia would refer to N areas.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Moreover, Luke prefers to refer to traditional regions than more recent political entities.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Favoring S:
<ul>
<li>τὴν Φρυγίαν καὶ Γαλατικὴν χώραν (16:6) should be interpreted as "the Phrygian territory incorporated in the province of Galatia." The article associates both regions as an adjective of one reigion (χώραν).</li>
<li>The sequence of movements can be explained
<ul>
<li>The participle κωλυθέντες in 6:6 is translated as simultaneous to Διῆλθον, "They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia and were prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in Asia" (so HCSB).</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Caveat
<ul>
<li>It's possible to hold to the S. Galatian theory and still argue that Gal 2:1-10 and Acts 15 refer to the same event (so Moisés Silva).</li>

<ul>
<li>Treatment of Abraham and Gen 15:6 in Gal 3:7-29 and Rom 4 are different</li>
<li>Focus on different aspects of justification: time</li>
<li>Romans has no autobiographical section in Gal 1:1-2; 14</li>

<ul>
<li>Treatment of Abraham and Gen 15:6 in Gal 3:27-29 and Rom 4 are different</li>
<li>Focus on different aspects of justification
<ul>
<li>Time of justification
<ul>
<li>Generally, people understand that "justified by faith" = entrance to the Christian experience
<ul>
<li>Romans: definitive initial justification 5;1, 9; 8:30.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Galatians: most are timeless or future
<ul>
<li>timeless/undetermined: 2:16, 21; 3:8, 11, 24</li>
<li>future in 2:17; 5:4–5</li>
<li>present [by implication] in 3:6</li>
<li>Rationale:
<ul>
<li>This makes sense in light of the situation in Galatia
<ul>
<li>Paul argues that based on the <b>good start</b> that they have, the Galatians must <b>press onward</b>. Thus, it's not surprising that justification has a gnomic quality. A definitive act of justification is presumed. Paul insists that they need to <b>maintain</b> their status or righteousness so that they can expect to be found "in the right" at the judgment.</li>
<li>2nd temple Judaism: They viewed God's election as the ultimate basis for their place in the covenant, but they tacitly assumed that since they have been born into it, they were always within the covenant.</li>
<li>In this scenario, the question is not how one "gets in" initially or how "one stays in"; but how one "gets into" the eternal kingdom on the day of judgment.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Summary:
<ul>
<li>Galatians is
<ul>
<li>NOT mainly about
<ul>
<li>sanctification</li>
<li>how to live</li>
<li>initial justification</li>

</ul></li>
<li>BUT about
<ul>
<li>ultimate justification
<ul>
<li>The false teachers argued that this vindication, promised only to Israel, can be experienced only by those who identify with Israel by doing Torah.</li>
<li>Paul reads salvation history in light of the apocalyptic significance of the cross. He insists that faith (and faith alone, accompanied by the transforming power of the Spirit) maintains one's relationship to Christ, in whose person the people of God are now constituted.</li>
<li>By supplementing their faith in Christ with torah observance, they run the risk of forfeiting their standing in christ and failing to achieve their final vindication.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Romans has no autobiographical section in Gal 1:1-2; 14</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Should we read everything as a response to the opponents' position?</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>"difficulty lies in the fact that it is not always possible to distinguish among (1) exposition, (2) polemic (i.e., an aggressive explication), and (3) apology (i.e., a defensive response), and mirror reading works only where there is reasonable assurance that we are dealing with either polemic or apology." (WBC)
<ul>
<li>That is, it is only when Paul is engaged in polemic and apology that he is intentionally refuting his opponents. Thus, it is only in these passages that we can construct the opponent's position from the opposite of what Paul affirms.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Reversing Paul's affirmations may be helpful to get some idea on what the opponents taught and why the taught as they did. Other times, it may reflect how the Galatians understood the matter. Often, however, they only give us how Paul in the heat of controversy characterized (or even caricatured) their teaching and activity, which may not be how they saw themselves. (WBC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Paul may not know precisely who are troubling the Galatians.</li>
<li>They were not part of the Galatian church</li>
<li>Jewish Christians</li>
<li>Possibly some connection with the Jerusalem church.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Paul may not know precisely who are troubling the Galatians.
<ul>
<li>He refers to them generally as “some people” (τινές) and “anybody” (τις) in his opening statement of the problem (1:7–9); he asks during the course of his treatment such questions as “Who has bewitched you?” (3:1) and “Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth?” (5:7); and he warns, “The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he may be” (5:10), with the singulars of 1:9 and 5:10 best seen as generic singulars (WBC)</li>
<li>He may have heard some report of the effect of the agitators on the Galatians and may have heard about their essential argument. But we don't know any more than this.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>They were not part of the Galatian church
<ul>
<li>Paul always refers to the agitators in the 3rd person</li>
<li>He addresses his converts in the 2nd person (Bruce, 24-25).</li>
<li>Drane notes that it is unlikely that the people Paul converted would so quickly turn against him. It is therefore more likely that agitators from the ouside came in and confused the young believers.</li>
<li>Ignore: Tyson, "Opponents in Galatia," thinks that they are Christian Jews native to Galatia. This is possible. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that they came from outside the congregation.</li>
<li>Ignore: Watson: The reason why Paul talks so much in ch. 2 about previous disputes in Jerusalem and Antioch is because the Galatian crisis was a continuation of those controversies.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Jewish Christians
<ul>
<li>Jewish: emphasis on circumcision, obeying the law</li>
<li>Christian: preaching of a gospel message; desire to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ
<ul>
<li>Thus, these Judaizers believed that Jesus was the Christ.
<ul>
<li>This view is challenged by
<ul>
<li>Muddiman</li>
<li>Nanos
<ul>
<li>The reference to another gospel should be interpreted ironically (1:6-7) and their refusal to be persecuted for the sake of the cross (6:12) should not be understood to say that they claimed to be Christians.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Critique of the view that opponents didn't believe that Jesus was the Christ
<ul>
<li>Paul nowhere criticizes the opponents for failing to believe that Jesus is the Christ. He would have done this, as we see in 1-2 John.</li>
<li>Paul would have argued at length that Jesus was indeed the Christ.</li>
<li>It seems more probable that the opponents would have made inroads in the Galatian congregation if they agreed significantly with Paul's gospel, while also maintaining that Paul's gospel must be supplemented and improved.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Since the argument of the letter is for the readers to reject an offer of an alternative Gospel that includes circumcision and Jewish feast days, it is highly likely that the agitators were both Jews and Christians.</li>
<li>They are Judaizers, i.e., they wanted to observe a Jewish way of life, a way of life prescribed in the OT laws.</li>
<li>Bruce: Pharisaic Jews from Palestine. Probably similar to the Pharisaic opponents in Acts 15. Identify them as Judaizers.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Possibly some connection with the Jerusalem church. 
<ul>
<li>They may come with high qualifications and/or were appealing to a higher authority (suggested by the ironic allusion "angel from heaven")</li>
<li>Evidence: mention of Jersusalem at various points.</li>
<li>But probably not commissioned by James or the Jerusalem church
<ul>
<li>There is no evidence that these agitators were commissioned by James/Jerusalem church to undertake these tasks. But they appear to have some connections with the Jerusalem church (cf. Acts 15:1).</li>
<li>We should probably distinguish between the agitators in Galatia and the "men who came from James," although one can argue that the latter came to Antioch and exceeded the limits of what James sent them to do.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Intent: To thwart Zealot purification against the Judean church
<ul>
<li>With the rising tide of Jewish nationalism in Palestine and antagonism of all who had Gentile sympathies&#x2026;
<ul>
<li>If they succeed in circumcising the Gentile Christians, this would then thwart any Zealot persecution of the Jerusalem church. Moreover, they could boast if they could induce the Gentile churches to enter the rank of the circumcised&#x2026;. It is this that Paul said "they wish to put up a good show in the flesh" (6:12).</li>
<li>See Jewett, NTS 17 (1971), 198–212)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Jewish Christians from Jerusalem who were motivated by concern for the welfare of Palestinian Christians amidst the rising pressures of Jewish nationalism and so carried on a judaizing campaign among Paul’s converts in the Diaspora in order to thwart any Zealot purification campaign against the church back home (WBC)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Their view of Paul
<ul>
<li>They discredit Paul's apostolleship (Longenecker, Schreiner)
<ul>
<li>Paul was not an original apostle. He was dependent and subordinate to the leadership of the Jeruaslem church (1:10-24).
<ul>
<li>Paul's refutation: Paul argues that his gosple came through a revelation of Jesus Christ (1:11-17)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Paul distorted the original message that he had received from the apostles (2:1-10).
<ul>
<li>He catered to Gentile wishes. He wanted success so badly that he abandoned the gospel that he usually preaches (5:11)</li>
<li>Paul's refutation: The apostles recognized and ratified the authenticity of his gospel (2:1-10).</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Seen in the way Paul so vigorously defends his independence and equality of his apostleship vis-a-vis that of the Jerusalem apostles, recounting his opposition to Peter, the men from James, and even Barbanabs.</li>
<li>The account of 2:1-10 seems to indicate that the opponents claimed that the Jerusalem apostles did not agree with the Pauline gospels.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>No evidence that they questioned Paul's apostolic status or his commission to preach to the Gentiles. There is also no evidence that the Galatians doubted Paul's apostolic office or commission. (BW3)
<ul>
<li>What is at stake in Galatians is not his apostolic status, but his Gospel. His apostolic status is only called into question indirectly because Paul perceives that his Gospel is being challenged and/or supplemented by the agitators. (BW3)</li>
<li>They claimed not to be opposing Paul but to be completing his message (3:3), and so bringing the Galatian Christians to perfection.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Teaching comes in 2 forms: elemental and developed.
<ul>
<li>Paul's message was an elemental form of the gospel</li>
<li>Theirs is developed.</li>

<li>Abraham
<ul>
<li>Gen 26:5 "because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions."</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Jewish commendation of the law in the Diaspora</li>
<li>Torah is a check on libertinism</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Why were the Galatians willing to accede?</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>They promoted observance of the law
<ul>
<li>This is debated
<ul>
<li>4:10 Although Paul talks about the law, he mentions few practicalities of law-observance except calendrical days
<ul>
<li>They were promoting various days of the calendar</li>

</ul></li>
<li>5:3 (μαρτύρομαι δὲ πάλιν παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ περιτεμνομένῳ ὅτι ὀφειλέτης ἐστὶν ὅλον τὸν νόμον ποιῆσαι) is ambiguous
<ul>
<li>Some think that the Galatians were unaware of their obligations to the law || Agitators were only interested in obvious and quick results (Jewett)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>6:13 (οὐδὲ γὰρ οἱ περιτεμνόμενοι αὐτοὶ νόμον φυλάσσουσιν)
<ul>
<li>Possibly imply that the agitators were not sincere in their observation of the law</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>BUT
<ul>
<li>Paul's sustained critique of the law shows the significance of the law in the Galatian dispute and in the message of the agitators.</li>
<li>So why 4:10
<ul>
<li>Both pagan and Jewish religion involve sacred days. Paul deliberately chose this to empahsize similarities between these 2 religions.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>So why 5:3
<ul>
<li>They were ignorant of this; perhaps, just naïve. They were prepared to submit to the law, but needed to face realistically the implications of observing the <i>whole</i> law. (Barclay, <i>Observing the Truth</i>, 64).</li>

</ul></li>
<li>So how about 6:13
<ul>
<li>Note the polemical context; this is meant to undermine the credibility of the agitators.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Their argument
<ul>
<li>They used Abraham in their arguments for the law as well as for circumcision
<ul>
<li>Gen 26:5 (Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge; my commandments, my statutes and my laws). It was assumed in Jewish traditions that Abraham had kept the law even before its promulgation in Sinai.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>In the Diaspora, Jews usually commended the law in the following ways
<ul>
<li>The law is a universal law, a law of nature</li>
<li>The law produced those qualities which were generally regarded as virtues in the Hellenistic world.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Jewish law is the divinely appointed way to check libertinism within the church.
<ul>
<li>Paul then refutes it based on
<ul>
<li>the pedagogical function of the law coming to an end with Christ</li>
<li>living by the direction of the Spirit as the antidote to libertinism</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Galatians' willingness to accede
<ul>
<li>Their willingness to identify as proselytes, with the Jewish nation and Jewish Christianity</li>
<li>Why were the Galatians willing to accept the law?
<ul>
<li>The law provided detailed instruction for the conduct of ordinary life.
<ul>
<li>We can't be certain what moral instruction Paul had left with them. 5:21 suggests that he had warned them about a list of vices. It is possible that he underestimated the needs of his Gentile converts for basic moral instruction. As long as Paul was present, he could instruct them. But in his absence, and without an established tradition of Christian ethics, his advice to 'walk in the Spirit' may appear unsatisfactory.</li>
<li>There were divisions within the church (5:15).</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Given the previous section's socological factors, the law would perform a crucial social function in prserving the Galatian Christian communities (Barclay, <i>Obey the Truth</i>, 72).</li>

<ul>
<li>Promoted circumcision</li>
<li>Why is circumcision necessary?</li>
<li>Why were they achieving success in Galatia? 
<ul>
<li>Background: Circumcision was generally disdained by Gentiles</li>
<li>Theological argument</li>
<li>Sociological argument</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>They promoted circumcision
<ul>
<li>Paul did preach circumcision (5:11).</li>
<li>But he withheld this from the Galatians so as to gain his converts' initial favorable response. So, he was more interested in winning their approval than God's.
<ul>
<li>Paul recounts the incident in Jerusalem when the false brothers tried to impose circumcision on Titus. He does this because what happened in Jerusalem // the situation in Galatia.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>They may also have stressed that the pillars of the church in Jerusalem were also circumcized Jews preaching the gospel to other Jews.
<ul>
<li>Paul's use of "those that appear/seem" (2:2, 6, 9) may be a reaction to the agitator's over-evaluation of these pillars. "Jerusalem is our mother" (4:26) may be an echo of such teaching.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Why is circumcision necessary?
<ul>
<li>So as to relate rightly to Abraham and the Abrahamic covenant, i.e. to be legitimate sons of Abraham and experience the full blessings of God's covenant with Abraham.</li>
<li>Circumcision was necessary for inclusion in the people of God.</li>
<li>If you want to be a son of Abraham, you must receive the covenantal sign. 
<ul>
<li>Probably appealed to Gen 17:9-14 where circumcision is required perpetually for both Abraham and his descendants. Thus, circumcision was not temporally limited because God calls the covenant "everlasting." They likely argued that circumcision was necessary for salvation.</li>
<li>We can infer from Gal 3-4 that they argued strongly for Abraham.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Why were they successful
<ul>
<li>How were the Galatians bewitched (3:1), persuaded (5:7), or compeled (6:12)?</li>
<li>Background: Circumcision was generally disdained by Gentiles. It was the most difficult hurdle for those who were attracted to Judaism and contemplated becoming proselytes, thus you have God-fearers in Acts.</li>
<li>Theological argument: Appeal to Scripture; Appeal to Abraham
<ul>
<li>Paul's emphatic reference to Abraham, his frequency, his clarity all suggest that Paul's opponents in Galatia appealed to Abraham in their persuasion of the Galatians.</li>
<li>Paul's converts were probably taught by him to regard the OT as their Scripture.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Sociological factors
<ul>
<li>Christians were socially dislocated and ostracized.</li>
<li>Paul's presence in Galatia provided social stability (note the lavish attention they gave to Paul; 4:12-15). When he left, there was social instability. They could not share in their national and ancestral religious practice, but neither were they members of the Jewish synagogue.</li>
<li>With a precarious social identity, we can understand how they were impressed by the agitator's message.</li>
<li>They reinforced the Galatians' inadequate status by deliberately refusing to eat with them, or withdrawing from them at the Lord's Supper (4:17; ἐκκλεῖσαι ὑμᾶς θέλουσιν; cf. 2:11-14)</li>
<li>By becoming proselytes, the Galatians could identify themselves with the local synagogues and hold a more understandable and recognizable place in society.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Options [Ignore]
<ul>
<li>Schmitals:
<ul>
<li>circumcision was a gnostic rite that portrayed the liberation of the pneuma-self from the prison of his body</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Brinsmead:
<ul>
<li>circumcision was presented as a powerful mystery initiation</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Jewett:
<ul>
<li>circumcision was fused to the Hellenistic idea of perfection.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Borgen:
<ul>
<li>Agitators consider Paul as their ally. Paul had already preached ethical circumcision (removal of the desires of the flesh). Agitators now present bodily circumcision as the counterpart to Paul's ethical circumcision.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Lütgert and Harvey
<ul>
<li>Pressure from local Jews (their standing vis-a-vis the Jewish community).</li>
<li>In this way, the Galatians would appease their opposition while also receiving protection from the state as a 'religio licita.'</li>
<li>But how was such pressure applied? Moreover, it seems likely that the agitators came from outside the community.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jewish-Christian missionaries are pressuring the Galatians to undergo circumcision and submission to the Mosaic law to complete their Christian experience.</li>
<li>Perspective of these missionaries
<ul>
<li>They stress a continuity in salvation history by arguing that the OT requires anyone to be the seed or children of Abraham to be circumcised and to commit to a life of obedience to the Torah
<ul>
<li>From a standard Jewish reading of the OT, only descendants of Abraham can hope for ultimate vindication on the day of judgement.</li>
<li>Jews affirm their identity as people of Abraham by circumcision and obedience to the Mosaic law.</li>
<li>They affirm that Jesus is the Messiah and that faith is now necessary for identification with God's people.</li>
<li>Gentiles can also become members of God's people.</li>
<li>But in order to experience eschatological salvation, Gentiles also needed to become descendants of Abraham by undergoing the traditional requirements imposed on converts to Judaism (circumcision and adherence to the Mosaic law).</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Even though Paul is addressing a single Christian-Jewish opposition, Paul is fighting 2 fronts: legalism (1:1-5:12) and antinomianism (5:13-6:10)</li>
<li>"to complete their Christian experience":
<ul>
<li>Using Sanders' terminology, they are focusing not on how to get in, but on how to stay in. However, the focus is not on how to stay in only, but on ultimate vindication in the judgment.</li>
<li>Dunn (See BW3, 25 n.47): The issue is neither getting in nor staying in, but ‘going on’ and how the Christians in Galatia were supposed to live out their faith.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>These agitators were acting in order to avoid persecuted for the cross of Christ (6:12). They did not want to give offense to fellow Jews.
<ul>
<li>This would be similar to "those from James" in Gal 2.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>These agitators claimed to represent Jerusalem. This makes sense of the Hagar-Sarah allegory where Paul contrasts the present Jerusalem with the Jerusalem above. Paul nevertheless identifies their perspective with Judaism in general.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Introduction: Desertion from the gospel (1:1–10)
<ul>
<li>Introduces the central issue: Paul is astonished that the Galatians are deserting the gospel, turning away from the grace that is theirs in the gospel of Christ. What they are turning to is not a gospel at all.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Source of the gospel: God, not man (1:11–2:14)
<ul>
<li>Paul argues that the gospel he preaches is not a human gospel but came through revelation of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>He does this to assure his readers that they have received the true gospel.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Truth of the gospel defined (2:15–21)
<ul>
<li>Paul explains what is the essence of his gospel; he delineates the gospel</li>
<li>Key point is in 2:16: Justification before God comes through faith in Jesus Christ and not through works of the law.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Defense for his gospel (3:1–4:7)
<ul>
<li>This section and the next constitute the central argument of the letter.</li>
<li>Here, Paul makes a defense of the gospel.</li>
<li>Arguments based from
<ul>
<li>experience: Reception of the Spirit is decisive evidence that they are justified by faith</li>
<li>Scripture: From Gen 15:6, Abraham believed God and was credited to him as righteousness. Therefore, those who have faith are Abe's children, and only these will receive Abe's blessings.</li>
<li>salvation history: Priority of Abe's covenant over Mosaic covenant</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Appeal for the gospel (4:8-5:12)
<ul>
<li>In previous section, Paul makes arguments. He may occasionally address his readers, but doesn't refer to them directly. Now, he addresses them directly and appeals to them.</li>
<li>Appeals to
<ul>
<li>freedom from the law
<ul>
<li>personal history: Reverting back to the law is returning to slavery under paganism</li>
<li>friendship: We were BFF. Paul rehearses his history with the Galatians, appeals to them to live in accord with the model he provides</li>
<li>allegory: believers are children of the free women, not the slave</li>

</ul></li>
<li>stand in the freedom that Christ brings
<ul>
<li>Paul now turns to the specific issue facing the Galatians: circumcision.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Life of the gospel: Living out freedom in the Spirit (5:13–6:10)
<ul>
<li>Agitators: Paul's version of the gospel does not provide sufficient means to fight the tendency of people to sin. You need clear dos and don'ts from the law.</li>
<li>Paul: 
<ul>
<li>Life lived under the gospel is a powerful and compelling alternative to live lived under the law. It is the only adequate means to maintain and confirm one's status of righteousness before God.</li>
<li>The Spirit enables believers to overcome the power of the flesh. By stimulating love for others, it provides for the true fulfillment of the law.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Closing: Not circumcision, but the new creation (6:11–18)
<ul>
<li>Summarizes many of the major themes</li>
<li>The cross of Christ is the decisive turning point in history so that the new creation is inaugurated. Hence, those who still advocate circumcision have denied the cross and belong to this present evil age.</li>
